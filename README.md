# dumbadmin

A source code audit challenge I did because I was bored.

Bob owns a service that lets you whether a link is alive or not. Bob will let an automated browser to visit the website and it will decide if it is valid or not. The result will then be changed on the admin panel by the bot.

Can you figure out bob's bot password?
